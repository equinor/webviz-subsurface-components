## üåã Usage
The component can be either used as an Dash-component or as a plain React component. This README will focus on Dash usages of the component.

### Getting started
Downloading the component
```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ webviz-subsurface-components
```

### Using the component

```python
import dash
import webviz-subsurface-components

layers = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Test Image",
        "baseLayer": True,
        "checked": True,
        "data": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "url": "LOCAL_IMAGE_FILE",
                "bounds": [[0, 0], [-30, -30]],
            }
        ]
    }
]

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

new_layered_map = webviz_subsurface_components.NewLayeredMap(
    id='test-map',
    layers=layers,
)

app.layout = html.Div(
    children=[
        new_layered_map
    ]
)

app.run_server(debug=True)

```

### Updating the layers
To update the layers basically provide a new list of _layers_ into the component with the changes to apply by id.

```python
COLORSCALE = ['#032333', '#2a3393', '#754792', '#b15d81', '#ea7859', '#fbb33c', '#e7fa5a']

layers = [
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Test Image",
        "baseLayer": True,
        "checked": True,
        "data": [
            {
                "type": "image",
                "url": "LOCAL_IMAGE_FILE",
                "bounds": [[0, 0], [-30, -30]],
            }
        ]
    }
]

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

new_layered_map = webviz_subsurface_components.NewLayeredMap(
    id='test-map',
    layers=layers,
)

app.layout = html.Div(
    children=[
        new_layered_map,
        html.Button(id='layer-add-btn'),
    ]
)

@app.callback(
    Output('test-map', 'layers'),
    [Input('layer-add-btn', 'n_clicks')]
)
def toggle_shader(n_clicks):

    if n_clicks is not None:
        # Add hillshading and custom colors
        return [
            {
                "id": 1,            # Required,
                "action": "update", # Required
                "data": [
                    {
                        "type": "tile",  # Required
                        "shader": {
                            "type": 'hillshading' if n_clicks%2 == 1 else None, 
                            "shadows": True,
                            "elevationScale": 4.0,
                            "pixelScale": 200
                        },
                        "colorScale": COLORSCALE if n_clicks%2 == 1 else None 
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    return []

app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## üìú Documentations

### ‚ù§ **ColorScales**

**Description**

Colorscale property is used to generate and apply a colormap to a desired layer.
It is capable of doing so by either generating a colormap from hexadecimal colors
provided by the user or by user providing the colormap directly (see examples below)

<br /> 

**Options**

| Name | Type  | Description  |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------|
| colors          | Array of strings | Used when generating a colormap based on hexadecimal values. Each of the hexadecimal color value should be represented  as a string within the array.                                            |
| prefixAlphaZero | Boolean          | Indicates whether the first color of the colormap should be set to transparent.                                                                                                                  |
| scaleType       | String           | Indicates the type of scale that should be used when generating the colormap. It is set to linear by default. Currently supported scale types:  	‚Ä¢ "log" 	‚Ä¢ "linear".                        |
| cutPointMin     | Integer          | Indicates the minimum height value represented in the map. Any value below it is set to transparent. If a value is lower than the minimum global value, it is set to the global minimum.  |
| cutPointMax     | Integer          | Indicates the maximum height value represented in the map. Any value below it is set to transparent. If a value is higher than the maximum global value, it is set to the global maximum. |

<br /> 

**Example usage**

The colorscale may be used in one of the following ways:

 - Specifying the hexadecimal color array along with the desired options as an      object


        "colorScale":  {
            "colors":["#0d0887", "#46039f", "#7201a8", "#9c179e", "#bd3786", "#d8576b", "#ed7953", "#fb9f3a", "#fdca26", "#f0f921"],
            "prefixZeroAlpha": false,
            "scaleType": "linear",
            "cutPointMin": 3000,
            "cutPointMax": 3513
        },

 - Assigning a colormap to the colorscale directly as a string
    

        "colorscale: "data:image/png;base64,    iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAQAAAAABCAYAAAAxWXB3AAAAuElEQVR4nI2NyxUDIQwDR6K0lJD+W1nnABgvIZ8DT7JGNnroieRAQjJYMFQ2SDBUk0mrl16odGce05de9Z2zzStLLhEuvurIZzeZOedizd7mT70f7JOe7v7XA/jBBaH4ztn3462z37l1c7/ys1f6QFNZuUZ+1+JZ3oVN79FxctLvLB/XIQuslbe3+eSv7LVyd/KmC9O13Vjf63zt7r3kW7dR/iVuvv/H8NBE1/SiIayhiCZjhDFN5gX8UYgJzVykqAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==",


### üåã Shaders
Currently the component only supports two types of shaders:
* _soft-hillshading_
* _hillshading_

Shaders only works for only two layer types - _image_- and _tile_-layers. You can specifiy that you want shading with the following way inside your layer data:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "type": 'image',
    "shader": {
        "type": SHADER_TYPE|null
        // Other shader spesific configuration goes here
    },
    ...
}
```

#### üèî Hillshading
Hillshading is a shader that generates elevation and senes of relief to images. It can be generated to the following way:
```javascript
{
    "shader": {
        "type": "hillshading",
        "shadows": true|false, // For enabling shadows
    }
}
```
This kind of hillshading might be expensive for huge images, especially with shadows. Shadows are the most expensive computation of the hillshading, so if it is not needed, make sure it is not enabled. However, the usages of the shadows can be optimized a bit, as the shadows are generated in _N_ iterations, where _N_ is automatically adjusted based on image size. With small images like 256x256, _N_ is set to 128, which shows really great shadows, but if you do the same for a 1000x1000 images, your browser might not handle it at all, and is therefore automatically set to _N_ = 8 for the biggest images. The result are not as great as before, but it is decent. On the other hand, it is possible force _N_ to be something else, which can be set with the _shadowIterations_-field:
```javascript
{
    "shader": {
        "type": "hillshading",
        "shadowIterations": 128 // <--- Expensive for huge images
    }
}
```

Here is a brief visualization of the hillshader with different kind of shadow-configuration.

##### Hillshading options
| Name             | Type          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Default   |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| pixelScale       | Number        | A indication on what is the scale of the pixels. A higher number will decrease the intensitiy of the shadows                                                                                                                                | 8000      |
| elevationScale   | Number        | ElevationScale is a variable for scaling the generated elevation of the image. The greater the scale, the higher the "_mountains_". If you have _shadows_ enabled, but see no shadows, maybe your elevation is too low.                     | 1.0       |
| shadows          | Boolean       | If shadows should be applied to the provided image or not. Note that shadows is quite heavy computational, especially for big images. Try to decrease the _shadowsIterations_ field if you have troubles rendering with shadows.            | false     |
| shadowIterations | Number        | The number of iterations the shadows should be applied on. The higher number of iterations the greater the result, but also more heavy the generation gets. Your browser might not support too high iteration-number, especially on Chrome. | null      |
| sunDirection     | Array<Number> | A vector of length 3 indicating the direction from the surface to the sun. Should be a normalized vector with values between 0 and 1.                                                                                                       | [1, 1, 1] |


#### Soft hillshading
If the normal hillshading-shader is too heavy computational, there is also a soft hillshader which is less computational, but provide less elevation-details compared to the other hillshader. Can be enabled with the following configuration:
```javascript
{
    ...
    "shader": {
        "type": "soft-hillshading",
        "elevationScale": 0.03, // Optional
    },
    ...
}
```

| elevationScale | Number        | A variable for scaling the generated elevation of the image. The greater the scale, the higher the "_mountains_". | 0.03      |
| lightDirection | Array<Number> | A vector of length 3 indicating the direction from the surface to the sun.                                        | [1, 1, 1] |
