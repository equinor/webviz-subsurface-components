# WellLogView examples

## Introduction
These stories contain examples of usage of components for visualization of well log data files.
There are two main examples: 
[WellLogViewer](?path=/story/welllogviewer-overview--page#welllogviewer-component) wich contains essential parts of typical well log viewer 
and [SyncLogViewer](?path=/story/welllogviewer-overview--page#synclogviewer-component) wich contains synchronized views for three different log files.

## WellLogView component
[WellLogView](?path=/docs/welllogviewer-components-welllogview--default) is a basic react component to wrap [ViDEx well log](https://github.com/equinor/videx-wellog) library for drawing well log data.

The component can zoom and pan visible area of tracks by mouse and support selecting of depth interval.

As input data it accept data files in following formats:
#### Well Log Data Format
The JSON Well Log Format is used in WellLogView component for input Well Log data files.

It is a modern well log format created in order to overcome the deficiencies of existing formats.
It is based on the JavaScript Object Notation open standard (RFC 8259). 
Full description of the format could be found on the site https://jsonwelllogformat.org .

The file format could be described with a following 
[JSON schema](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-components/blob/master/react/src/lib/inputSchema/WellLog.json)

#### Template Format
The JSON file describing content of well log view: what tracks should be displayed and what curves it should contains.

The file format could be described with a following 
[JSON schema](https://github.com/equinor/webviz-subsurface-components/blob/master/react/src/lib/inputSchema/WellLogTemplate.json)

#### Color Table Format
The JSON file used as a supplement to template file and describe color tables for visualizing different type of log curves.

See also [@emerson-eps/color-tables](https://github.com/emerson-eps/color-tables) component.


## WellLogViewer component
[A demo component](?path=/story/welllogviewer-demo-welllogviewer--default) to deal with WellLogView component.
It contains WellLogView component surrounded by auxiliary components: 
readout panel, axis selector and zoom slider.

The number and properties of tracks and curves could be interactively edited by corresponding content menus and dialog boxes.

## SyncLogViewer component
[An example](?path=/story/welllogviewer-demo-synclogviewer--default) for two linked WellLogView components.
It demonstrate how different well log views can be synchronized in such complex programs as well correlation applications.

The component architecture is similar to WellLogViewer's one but contains two views for well logs an two readout panels.
